# Gift Card Code Generator

This is a simple script that generates random gift card codes and validates them.

* Note - Code Doesn't Make Orignal Code, It's just was for Learning Purpose.

## Usage

To use this script, simply run the `gift_card_code_generator.py` file with Python 3. 


This will generate 10 random gift card codes, validate them, and save the results to text files. The generated gift card codes will be saved to `gift_card_codes.txt`, the valid gift card codes will be saved to `valid_gift_card_codes.txt`, and the invalid gift card codes will be saved to `invalid_gift_card_codes.txt`. Additionally, a log of all valid gift card codes will be saved to `gift_card_code_log.txt`.
